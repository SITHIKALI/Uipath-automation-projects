# Notes on UiPath Core RPA Components

- **Studio**: The development environment where automations are created. It provides a user-friendly interface for designing, building, and testing RPA workflows.
- **Orchestrator**: The web-based application used to manage, schedule, monitor, and deploy automation processes and robots. It acts as the central hub for controlling the RPA ecosystem.
- **Robots**: The agents that execute the automation workflows built in Studio. Robots can run attended (with human interaction) or unattended (fully automated) processes.

These are called the core components of the UiPath Platform because RPA cannot function without the ability to develop automations (Studio), execute them (Robots), and manage the entire automation ecosystem (Orchestrator).
